# docs2to3

Safari extension to automatically redirect you to the docs for a specified python version when coming from an external referrer (e.g. Google)

This is really useful if you (like me) always click the first Link to ```docs.python.org``` link, however the link for the current 3 version is (more likely than not) the second ;)
